# Severance-inspired GBA Video Game

"A Day at Lumon" is a narrative-driven adventure RPG developed as part of CS 2261 (Media Device Architecture) at Georgia Tech, reimagining the psychological themes of the Severance TV series within the technical constraints of Game Boy Advance hardware. 

Built completely in C, the game features tile-based level design, sprite animation, and custom UI assets that reflect the show’s minimalist corporate aesthetic. I designed all in-game artwork, including pixel environments, character sprites, and HUD elements, while implementing state-based scene transitions, trigger-based dialogue sequences, and inventory interactions. The project explored how limited-resolution visuals and sound can still convey atmosphere and narrative tension through deliberate visual hierarchy, pacing, and color theory.

Have fun! But don't get sent to the break room...
